```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Generate data
data <- data.frame(group = numeric(length = 100), 
                   null = numeric(length = 100), 
                   alternative = numeric(length = 100))
# Create grouping variable (50 observations in each)
set.seed(567)
data$group <- rep(c(0, 1), c(50, 50))

# Create null (group means do not differ)
data$null <- c(rnorm(50, mean = 10, sd = 2), runif(50, min = 4, max = 16))

# Create alternative (group means differ)
data$alternative[data$group == 0] <- c(rnorm(25, mean = 10, sd = 2), runif(25, min = 4, max = 16))
data$alternative[data$group == 1] <- c(rnorm(25, mean = 10, sd = 2), runif(25, min = 4, max = 16)) + 10

# Create difference between means of groups for null and alternative
null.diff <- mean(data$null[data$group == 1]) - mean(data$null[data$group == 0])
alt.diff <- mean(data$alternative[data$group == 1]) - mean(data$alternative[data$group==0])

# Create a function that randomly reassigns each observation to a different group and then takes the mean difference between these new groups.
one.test <- function(grouping, variable) {
                resampled.group <- sample(grouping)
                mean(variable[resampled.group == 1]) - mean(variable[resampled.group == 0])
            }

# Example of how resampling works:
data$resampled.group <- sample(data$group)
head(data[ , c("group", "resampled.group", "null", "alternative")], n = 10)
mean(data$null[data$resampled.group == 1]) - mean(data$null[data$resampled.group == 0])
null.diff
mean(data$alternative[data$resampled.group == 1]) - mean(data$alternative[data$resampled.group == 0])
alt.diff
data$resampled.group <- NULL

many.truenull <- replicate(1000, one.test(data$group, data$null))
many.falsenull <- replicate(1000, one.test(data$group, data$alternative))

hist(many.truenull)
abline(v=null.diff, lwd=2, col="purple")
mean(abs(many.truenull) > abs(null.diff))

hist(many.falsenull)
abline(v=alt.diff, lwd=2, col="purple")
mean(abs(many.falsenull) > abs(alt.diff))
```



As part of writing this post, I heavily borrowed from the code used in [Thomas Lumley and Ken Rices' presentation](http://faculty.washington.edu/kenrice/sisg/SISG-08-06.pdf) for the Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics, and used code and explanations from [Charlie Geyer's tutorial](http://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/old/5601/examp/perm.html) from his class at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities,
