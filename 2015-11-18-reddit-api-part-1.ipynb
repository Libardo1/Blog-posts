    "Early in my career (before I discovered all I wanted to do was work with data) I thought I wanted to be a relationships psychologist. I actually wrote my Ph.D. thesis on hurtful events in relationships, and my Honours thesis on romantic jealousy, so you get the point! I still have a bit of a fascination with people's relationship problems, so a guilty pleasure of mine is reading the subreddit [/r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships#hme). Given how much time I spend on this subreddit, it seemed like a good place for a first attempt at extracting JSON-encoded data from the web.\n",

    "1. **Setting up the environment.** This week's post will explain how to set up your environment with all the required packages in a way that lends itself to completely reproducible research.   \n",
    "2. **Extracting the data.** Next week, I will cover how to pull JSON-encoded data from reddit (using /r/relationships as my example) and put in into a `pandas DataFrame` for analysis.   \n",
    "3. **Cleaning and describing the data.** In two weeks I will demonstrate some data cleaning and basic descriptives in `pandas`.\n",
    "4. **Analysing the data.** I will end in three weeks by setting up some basic hypotheses and testing them using `pandas` and `scipy` and showing some plotting in `matplotlib`.   \n",

    "## Setting up a virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have Python and `pip` installed, it is best practice to create a virtual environment (or [**virtualenv**](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)) to contain all of the Python packages we need to use. I know what you're thinking - man, this seems so tedious and overly-complicated! Why can't I just install all of these packages straight onto my system? Just hear me out - once you see the benefits of using a virtualenv, you won't want to go back to installing your packages system-wide, I promise!\n",
    "\n",
    "So what makes a virtualenv so great? If you've been programming for a while you will have encountered problems where you try to run someone else's code (or even your own old scripts) and it throws an error as the version of the package has changed. Obviously this is a problem in any setting, but it is a particular challenge for data scientists trying to conduct [**reproducible research**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research). In a best case scenario, an analysis you have conducted with older versions of your dependencies may fail to work; in a worst case scenario, the analysis may yield a different answer without you realising. The situation gets even more complicated when you think that you'll likely have projects which rely on different versions of packages, or have a mixture of projects in Python 2 and Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtualenvs solve this issue by allowing you to create a number of self-contained environments with all of the dependencies required for a project. If you install your packages within a virtualenv, it doesn't matter if you have multiple versions of a package contained on your computer; because the virtualenvs can't 'see' each other, you can safely have all of these versions installed simultaneously. It also doesn't matter if you use both Python 2 and Python 3, as you can specify which version of Python you want your virtualenv to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to use virtualenvs is through a wrapper specific to your [shell interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell). For example, an option for both [Bash in OSX](http://jamie.curle.io/posts/installing-pip-virtualenv-and-virtualenvwrapper-on-os-x/) and [CMD.exe in Windows](http://www.tylerbutler.com/2012/05/how-to-install-python-pip-and-virtualenv-on-windows-with-powershell/) is [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). In my case I use [Fish](http://fishshell.com/) in OSX, so I will carry out the rest of this tutorial using it and its associated wrapper [virtualfish](http://virtualfish.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To start a new virtualenv with virtualfish, we simply go into the shell and type `vf new <envname>`. I'll call this virtualenv `reddit_api`."
